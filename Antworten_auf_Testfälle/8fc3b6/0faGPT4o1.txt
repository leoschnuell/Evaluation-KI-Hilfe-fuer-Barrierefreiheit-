The issue with the provided HTML code is that the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `<object>` element is not correctly referencing an accessible name. The `aria-labelledby` attribute should point to an element that contains a meaningful label, which is not the case with an empty `<span>` element.

To fix this, you need to provide a meaningful label inside the `<span>` element that the `aria-labelledby` attribute can reference. Here is the corrected version of the HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Fixed Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <span id="label">W3C Logo</span> 
    <object aria-labelledby="label" data="/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png"></object>
</body>
</html>
```

In this corrected version:
- The `<span>` element with `id="label"` now contains the text "W3C Logo".
- The `aria-labelledby="label"` attribute on the `<object>` element references this `<span>` element, providing a meaningful label for screen readers and improving accessibility.

This ensures that the object is correctly labeled, making the content more accessible for users who rely on assistive technologies.
