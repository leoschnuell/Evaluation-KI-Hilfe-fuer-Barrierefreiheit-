The HTML code you provided has an accessibility issue related to the use of multiple `<nav>` elements. According to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), each `<nav>` element should have a unique purpose and be distinguishable for assistive technologies. 

The problem here is the use of two `<nav>` elements without providing a clear distinction between them. This can confuse users who rely on screen readers, as they won't know the specific purpose of each navigation section.

To fix this issue, you should add `aria-label` attributes to each `<nav>` element to describe their purpose. This will help screen readers convey the correct information to users.

Here is the revised code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Fixed Example</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/test-assets/non-visual-reference-alternative-9bd38c/columns.css" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C homepage</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">Standards</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</nav>
		<div class="col-container">
			<div class="col">
				<p>Find the navigation on the right, for the non-essential links</p>
			</div>
			<nav aria-label="Secondary navigation">
				<div class="col">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/contact">Contact</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://www.w3.org/Help/">Help and FAQ</a>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</nav>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

In this revised version:
- The main navigation `<nav>` element has an `aria-label="Main navigation"`.
- The secondary navigation `<nav>` element has an `aria-label="Secondary navigation"`.

These `aria-label` attributes provide clear distinctions between the two navigation sections, improving accessibility for users relying on screen readers.
