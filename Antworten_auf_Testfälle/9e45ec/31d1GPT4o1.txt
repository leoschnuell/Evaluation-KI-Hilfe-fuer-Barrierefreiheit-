The given HTML code snippet contains an issue with the CSS rule applied to the paragraph (`<p>`) element. The use of `!important` within the `style` attribute may be causing the problem, as it isn't necessary in this context and might interfere with other stylesheets.

Here's a cleaned-up version of the code without the `!important` declaration:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Failed Example 1</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p style="word-spacing: 0.1em;">
        The toy brought back fond memories of being lost in the rain forest.
    </p>
</body>
</html>
```

However, if there is another CSS file or rule that is conflicting with this style, using `!important` might be necessary to ensure that the `word-spacing` is applied. If this is the case, hereâ€™s how you could structure the code with `!important`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Failed Example 1</title>
    <style>
        p.custom-word-spacing {
            word-spacing: 0.1em !important;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="custom-word-spacing">
        The toy brought back fond memories of being lost in the rain forest.
    </p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this version, the CSS rule is defined within a `<style>` block in the `<head>`, and the class `custom-word-spacing` is applied to the `<p>` element. This method keeps the HTML clean and separates the content from the styling.
