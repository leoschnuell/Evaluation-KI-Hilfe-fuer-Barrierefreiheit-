The code provided seems to be almost correct, but there's a minor issue related to accessibility. The `<a>` element has an `aria-label` attribute, which is generally used to provide an accessible name for the link. However, the visible text "ACT rules" should be descriptive enough, and the `aria-label` should provide additional context if needed, or it might be redundant.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the code that either removes the unnecessary `aria-label` or ensures that the `aria-label` provides additional meaningful context:

### Option 1: Removing the unnecessary `aria-label`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>Failed Example 1</title>
</head>
<body>
	<a href="https://act-rules.github.io/">ACT rules</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Option 2: Ensuring the `aria-label` provides additional context

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>Failed Example 1</title>
</head>
<body>
	<a href="https://act-rules.github.io/" aria-label="WCAG ACT rules website">ACT rules</a>
</body>
</html>
```

In Option 1, the `aria-label` is removed because the visible text "ACT rules" is sufficient for most users, including those using screen readers.

In Option 2, the `aria-label` is kept but modified to provide additional context, making it clear what the link is about for screen reader users.

Choose the option that best fits your needs. If the visible text is descriptive enough, Option 1 is preferable. If you need to add more context for accessibility reasons, go with Option 2.
