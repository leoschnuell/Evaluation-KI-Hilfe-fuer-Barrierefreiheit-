The problem with the provided HTML code is that it uses the same `id` attribute value ("label") for both the `<div>` and the `<svg>` elements. The `id` attribute should be unique within a document. This causes the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `<input>` element to reference multiple elements with the same `id`, which is not valid and can lead to unpredictable behavior.

To fix the issue, you need to ensure that each `id` attribute is unique. Here is the corrected version of the HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>Fixed Example 2</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="label-name">Name</div>
	<svg id="label-city">
		<text x="0" y="15">City</text>
	</svg>
	
	<input aria-labelledby="label-city" type="text" name="city" />
</body>
</html>
```

In this corrected version:
- The `div` element has the `id` "label-name".
- The `svg` element has the `id` "label-city".
- The `input` elementâ€™s `aria-labelledby` attribute now correctly references the `id` "label-city".
