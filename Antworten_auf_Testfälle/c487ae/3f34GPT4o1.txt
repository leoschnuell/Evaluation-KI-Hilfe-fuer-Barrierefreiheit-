The given HTML code has an issue with accessibility. The `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `<img>` element points to an element with `id="id1"`, but this element is empty. The `aria-labelledby` attribute is used to provide an accessible name for an element by referencing the `id` of another element that contains the descriptive text.

To fix this, you need to add some descriptive text to the element with `id="id1"`. Here is the corrected code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>Failed Example 6</title>
</head>
<body>
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI"><img src="/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" aria-labelledby="id1"/></a>
	<div id="id1">W3C Logo</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this corrected version, the `<div>` with `id="id1"` now contains the text "W3C Logo". This text will be used as the accessible name for the image, improving its accessibility.
