The HTML code you provided has an issue with the `aria-sort` attribute. The `aria-sort` attribute is used to indicate the current sort direction of a sortable column, and it should only be applied to elements within a table that can be sorted (like a `th` element). Additionally, the `aria-sort` attribute should have a valid value such as `"ascending"`, `"descending"`, `"none"`, or `"other"`. 

Here’s how you can correct the code:

1. Remove the `aria-sort` attribute from the `button` element because it is not applicable outside the context of a sortable table column.
2. Optionally, if you intend to indicate sorting functionality on the button, consider using a different approach, such as a data attribute or visually indicating the sort state.

Here’s the corrected version of your code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>Fixed Example</title>
</head>
<body>
	<button>Sort by year</button>
</body>
</html>
```

If you are looking to implement sorting functionality and indicate the sort state with ARIA attributes in a table, here’s an example of how to use `aria-sort` correctly:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>Sortable Table Example</title>
</head>
<body>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col" aria-sort="none">Year</th>
				<th scope="col">Name</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>2021</td>
				<td>John Doe</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2020</td>
				<td>Jane Doe</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<script>
		const th = document.querySelector('th[aria-sort]');
		th.addEventListener('click', () => {
			let sortOrder = th.getAttribute('aria-sort');
			sortOrder = (sortOrder === 'ascending' || sortOrder === 'none') ? 'descending' : 'ascending';
			th.setAttribute('aria-sort', sortOrder);
			// Add your sorting logic here
		});
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `aria-sort` attribute is correctly used on a table header cell (`th`). The script toggles the `aria-sort` attribute between `ascending` and `descending` when the header is clicked.
