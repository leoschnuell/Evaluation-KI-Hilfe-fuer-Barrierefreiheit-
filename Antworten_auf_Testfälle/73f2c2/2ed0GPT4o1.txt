The issue with the provided HTML code lies in the incorrect value for the `autocomplete` attribute. The value "badname" is not a valid value for the `autocomplete` attribute. The `autocomplete` attribute is used to specify if the browser should attempt to autocomplete the input based on the user's previously entered values, and it should have valid values such as "on", "off", or specific input purposes like "username" or "email".

Here is the corrected HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>Fixed Example</title>
</head>
<body>
	<label>Username<input autocomplete="username"/></label>
</body>
</html>
```

In this corrected version, the `autocomplete` attribute is set to "username", which is a valid value and will allow the browser to suggest previously entered usernames for the input field.
