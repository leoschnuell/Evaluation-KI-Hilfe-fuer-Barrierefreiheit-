The HTML snippet provided uses the `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` tag, which instructs the browser to refresh the page after a specified number of seconds. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each tag does:

1. `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0: https://w3.org" />`: This tag will redirect the browser to "https://w3.org" immediately when the page is loaded.

2. `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="72001; https://w3.org" />`: This tag will attempt to redirect the browser to "https://w3.org" after 72001 seconds (which is approximately 20 hours). However, since the first tag already causes an immediate redirection, this tag will never take effect.

Here is the corrected HTML if you intended to have a delayed refresh:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="72001; url=https://w3.org" />
</head>
</html>
```

This version will redirect the browser to "https://w3.org" after 72001 seconds, without an immediate redirection.
