To improve the accessibility of your HTML code, here are some suggestions to address potential barrier-free issues:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
</head>
<body>
    <nav aria-label="Chapter Navigation">
        <a href="/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Read Chapter 2</a>
    </nav>

    <aside id="about-book" role="complementary">
        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a 14th century historical novel.</p>
    </aside>

    <main id="main">
        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <p>
            Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
            of time.
        </p>
    </main>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Document Structure**:
   - Added `<meta charset="UTF-8">` for character encoding.
   - Added `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` for responsive design.

2. **Navigation**:
   - Wrapped the chapter link in a `<nav>` element with `aria-label` to indicate its purpose.

3. **Headings**:
   - Added `<h1>` for the chapter title to establish a clear document structure and improve navigation for screen readers.

4. **Roles**:
   - Used `role="complementary"` for the `<aside>` to signify its supporting role in relation to the main content.

5. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Used the `<main>` element to clearly denote the primary content of the page.

### Additional Suggestions:
- Consider providing more context or links to previous chapters if applicable.
- Ensure links have descriptive text that makes sense out of context for better usability.
