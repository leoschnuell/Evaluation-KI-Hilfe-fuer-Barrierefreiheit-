The HTML code you provided appears mostly correct, but there are a few potential improvements and considerations for ensuring better compatibility and functionality:

1. **Adding Metadata**: It is always good practice to include meta tags within the head section to specify the character set and viewport settings. This ensures proper rendering and touch zooming on different devices.

2. **Providing Alternative Text for Accessibility**: While the video tag itself doesn't have an attribute for alternative text, it's important to provide descriptive text for accessibility. A good way to do this is by using the `<track>` element for subtitles or captions.

3. **Ensuring Correct File Path**: Make sure the video file path is correct and accessible.

4. **Improving Semantic Structure**: Consider using more semantic HTML tags for better structure and accessibility.

Here's the updated version of your HTML code with these improvements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Failed Example 3</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        The video below shows a man working on a keyboard. A voiceover is heard saying the following text: Web accessibility
        perspectives. Keyboard compatibility. Not being able to use your computer because your mouse doesn't work, is
        frustrating. Many people use only the keyboard to navigate websites. Either through preference or circumstance.
    </p>
    <video src="/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/test-assets/perspective-video/perspective-video.mp4" controls>
        <track kind="captions" src="/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/test-assets/perspective-video/perspective-video.vtt" srclang="en" label="English">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Changes and Additions:
1. **Meta Tags**:
    ```html
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    ```

2. **Track Element**:
    ```html
    <track kind="captions" src="/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/test-assets/perspective-video/perspective-video.vtt" srclang="en" label="English">
    ```
   This assumes you have a corresponding `.vtt` file for captions. If not, you can create one or remove this line.

3. **Fallback Text**:
    ```html
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    ```
   This provides fallback text for browsers that do not support the video tag.

### Additional Considerations:
- **File Paths**: Ensure the paths to your video and caption files are correct relative to the HTML file.
- **Testing**: Test the HTML file in different browsers to ensure compatibility and proper functionality.
