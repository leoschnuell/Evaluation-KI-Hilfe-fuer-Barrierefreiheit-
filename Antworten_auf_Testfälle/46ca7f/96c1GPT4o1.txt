The issue with the provided HTML code lies in the use of the `hidden` attribute on the `<span>` element that contains the label for the image. When an element is hidden using the `hidden` attribute, it is not accessible to assistive technologies like screen readers, which means the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `<img>` element will not work as intended. 

To make the label accessible, you can use CSS to visually hide the label while keeping it accessible to screen readers. Here's how you can fix the problem:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Fixed Example</title>
    <style>
        .visually-hidden {
            position: absolute;
            width: 1px;
            height: 1px;
            margin: -1px;
            padding: 0;
            overflow: hidden;
            clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
            border: 0;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <img src="/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" alt="" aria-labelledby="label" />
    <span id="label" class="visually-hidden">W3C logo</span>
</body>
</html>
```

In this updated version:

1. A `.visually-hidden` CSS class is defined to hide elements visually while keeping them accessible to screen readers.
2. The `<span>` element with the label now uses this `.visually-hidden` class instead of the `hidden` attribute.

This ensures that the label is available to assistive technologies, thus making the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `<img>` element functional.
