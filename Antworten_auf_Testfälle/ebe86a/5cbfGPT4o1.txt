The provided HTML and JavaScript code contains an issue related to focus management between two buttons (`btn1` and `btn2`). The intention seems to be to trap focus between these two buttons when `btn1` is blurred (loses focus), but it is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the onblur events are not functioning as intended because `onblur` might not be firing consistently as expected in some browsers or contexts.

Here is a corrected version of the code to ensure proper focus trapping between the two buttons:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<title>Fixed Example 3</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		var trapOn = false;

		document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
			var btn1 = document.getElementById('btn1');
			var btn2 = document.getElementById('btn2');

			btn1.addEventListener('blur', function() {
				if (trapOn) {
					btn2.focus();
				}
			});

			btn2.addEventListener('blur', function() {
				if (trapOn) {
					btn1.focus();
				}
			});
		});
	</script>
	
	<a id="link1" href="#">Link 1</a>
	<button id="btn1" onclick="trapOn = true;">
		Button 1
	</button>
	<p>Press the M-key to Exit</p>
	<button id="btn2">
		Button 2
	</button>
	<a id="link2" href="#">Link 2</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
1. **JavaScript Initialization**: The `DOMContentLoaded` event is used to ensure that the DOM elements are fully loaded before attaching event listeners. This avoids any issues with elements not being available at the time the script runs.
2. **Event Listeners for Blur**: Separate `blur` event listeners are added to `btn1` and `btn2`. When `btn1` loses focus, it checks if `trapOn` is true and then sets focus to `btn2`. Similarly, when `btn2` loses focus, it sets focus back to `btn1` if `trapOn` is true.
3. **Simplified Trap Activation**: The `onclick` event of `btn1` is used to activate the focus trap by setting `trapOn` to true. This makes the focus trapping logic straightforward and easy to understand.

With these changes, the focus will correctly cycle between `btn1` and `btn2` when `btn1` is clicked to activate the trap.
